# Structural SVM leadership detection

This work is part of my Machine Learning assignment in my master's. The aim of the project was to understand the concept of structured learning, and to apply it to learn how to recognize leaders in social groups moving in a crowd of people.

In particular, my group and I developed this Matlab software that takes advantage of time-lag features, Pagerank graph analysis and Structural Support Vector Machines. 

A detailed description of the algorithm can be found in this [draft paper](http://www.davideabati.com/resources/leaders.pdf).

A [demonstration video](https://youtu.be/XRNe_qRAifk) is available on YouTube.
